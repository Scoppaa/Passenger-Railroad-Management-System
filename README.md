CSI3450 Database Design Project
This demo was created locally with a database hosted on Oakland University's SECS server. The FTP client Filezilla was used to communicate with the server.

The database was created and administered with PHPMyAdmin. Foreign keys were embedded in tables and test queries were run here.

The web interface was created with PHP using the Brackets IDE. Javascript was used for some functionality. The bootstrap framework was implemented for styling along with CSS.
